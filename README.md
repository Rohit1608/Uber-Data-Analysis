# Uber Data Analytics Project
## Introduction
The Uber Data Analytics | Modern Data Engineering GCP Project is an exciting initiative that focuses on constructing a robust data pipeline to analyze Uber data efficiently. By leveraging various technologies and tools, this project aims to gain valuable insights from Uber’s trip records. Let’s break it down:

## Objective:
The primary goal is to extract meaningful information from Uber trip data, enabling better decision-making and understanding of user behavior.
We’ll explore pick-up and drop-off patterns, fare trends, and other relevant metrics.

## Technology Stack:
#### Programming Language: Python
#### Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
#### GCP Storage: Used for storing raw data files.
#### Compute Instance: Provides scalable compute resources.
#### BigQuery: A powerful data warehouse for querying and analyzing large datasets.
### Modern Data Pipeline Tool:
Integration with Mage Data Pipeline Tool ensures efficient data movement and transformation.

## Dataset Used
The project relies on the TLC Trip Record Data, which includes both yellow and green taxi trip records. Here are the key details about the dataset:

## Source: Uber Data CSV
Contents:
Each record contains information such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, distances, fares, payment types, and passenger counts.
The dataset provides a rich source of data for analysis and exploration.
